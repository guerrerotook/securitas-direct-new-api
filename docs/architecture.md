# Architecture Guide

This document explains how the Securitas Direct integration works, aimed at developers who want to contribute.

## System overview

The integration has three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Home Assistant Platform Layer                          │
│  alarm_control_panel.py  sensor.py  lock.py  button.py  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  exceptions.py                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every API call goes through `ApiManager._execute_request()`, which sends GraphQL mutations/queries over HTTP to Securitas' cloud. The integration hub (`SecuritasHub`) wraps the API client and is shared by all entity platforms. Each platform creates entities for the installations discovered at startup.

## API client layer

**Location:** `custom_components/securitas/securitas_direct_new_api/`

### ApiManager (`apimanager.py`)

The core API client. All communication with Securitas happens through GraphQL POST requests to country-specific endpoints (e.g. `customers.securitasdirect.es/owa-api/graphql`).

**Request execution:** Every API call goes through `_execute_request()`, which:
1. Builds HTTP headers including `app`, `auth` (JSON with JWT hash, user, country), `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-NAME`, and optionally `numinst`/`panel`/`X-Capabilities` for installation-scoped requests
2. POSTs the GraphQL payload as JSON
3. Parses the response and raises `SecuritasDirectError` on connection or API errors. Note: `_execute_request` passes through GraphQL error responses (no top-level `data` key) without raising — callers like `arm_alarm()` and `disarm_alarm()` check for this and raise `SecuritasDirectError` with the error message

**Device spoofing:** The client identifies itself as a Samsung Galaxy S22 running the Securitas mobile app v10.102.0. Device identity consists of three IDs generated at setup time: `device_id` (FCM-format token), `uuid` (16-char hex), and `id_device_indigitall` (UUID v4).

**Authentication** is JWT-based with three mechanisms:

1. **Login** (`login()`) — Sends credentials, receives a JWT hash token. The JWT's `exp` claim sets `authentication_token_exp`. If the account needs 2FA, raises `Login2FAError`.

2. **Token refresh** (`refresh_token()`) — Uses a long-lived refresh token to get a new JWT without re-entering credentials. Falls back to full login if refresh fails.

3. **2FA device validation** (`validate_device()`) — For new devices: calls `validate_device()` which returns a list of phone numbers. The user picks one, `send_otp()` sends the SMS, then `validate_device()` is called again with the OTP code to complete registration.

**Token lifecycle:** Before every API operation, `_check_authentication_token()` checks whether the JWT expires within the next minute. If so, it tries `refresh_token()` first, falling back to `login()`. Similarly, `_check_capabilities_token()` checks a per-installation capabilities JWT that's obtained from `get_all_services()`.

**Polling pattern:** Arm, disarm, status-check, and exception-fetch operations are asynchronous on the server side. The client sends the initial request, receives a `referenceId`, then polls a status endpoint in a loop (sleeping `delay_check_operation` seconds between attempts) until the response changes from `"WAIT"` to `"OK"` or a timeout is reached. All polling loops use the same dynamic `max_retries` formula: `max(10, round(30 / delay_check_operation))`, giving a consistent ~30-second total timeout.

### Country routing (`domains.py`)

`ApiDomains` maps country codes to API URLs and language codes. Supported countries: ES, FR, GB, IE, IT, BR, CL, AR, PT. Countries without an explicit entry fall back to a URL template using the country code as a subdomain.

### Alarm states and commands (`const.py`)

Securitas alarms have two independent axes: **interior mode** (disarmed, partial day, partial night, total) and **perimeter** (on or off). The combination produces 10 states defined in `SecuritasState`:

| State | Interior | Perimeter | API Command | Proto Code |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `DISARMED` | off | off | `DARM1` | `D` |
| `PARTIAL_DAY` | day | off | `ARMDAY1` | `P` |
| `PARTIAL_NIGHT` | night | off | `ARMNIGHT1` | `Q` |
| `TOTAL` | full | off | `ARM1` | `T` |
| `PERI_ONLY` | off | on | `PERI1` | `E` |
| `PARTIAL_DAY_PERI` | day | on | `ARMDAY1PERI1` | `B` |
| `PARTIAL_NIGHT_PERI` | night | on | `ARMNIGHT1PERI1` | `C` |
| `TOTAL_PERI` | full | on | `ARM1PERI1` | `A` |

Most compound commands (`ARMDAY1PERI1`, `ARM1PERI1`) are accepted by all known panels. However, `ARMNIGHT1PERI1` and `DARM1DARMPERI` are rejected by some panels (e.g. SDVFAST in Spain). The integration auto-detects which mode the panel supports (see [Compound command auto-detection](#compound-command-auto-detection) below).

**Panel-specific `DARM1` behavior:** On SDVFAST (Spain), `DARM1` disarms everything (interior + perimeter). On SDVECU (Italy), `DARM1` only disarms the interior — `DARMPERI` disarms only the perimeter, and `DARM1DARMPERI` disarms both. This difference is safe because the `DARM1` fallback only triggers on panels that reject `DARM1DARMPERI` (i.e. SDVFAST, where `DARM1` disarms everything).

Four mapping tables connect these:
- `STATE_TO_COMMAND` — `SecuritasState` to API command string (e.g. `TOTAL` -> `"ARM1"`)
- `PROTO_TO_STATE` — single-letter protocol response code to `SecuritasState` (e.g. `"T"` -> `TOTAL`)
- `COMPOUND_COMMAND_STEPS` — commands known to fail on some panels, mapped to multi-step fallbacks (e.g. `"ARMNIGHT1PERI1"` -> `("ARMNIGHT1", "PERI1")`, `"DARM1DARMPERI"` -> `("DARM1",)`)
- `PERI_ARMED_PROTO_CODES` — protocol codes where the perimeter is armed (`{"E", "B", "C", "A"}`), used to decide whether a combined disarm command is needed

#### Compound command auto-detection

Most compound commands work on all known panels, but two are rejected by SDVFAST (Spain):

| Command | SDVFAST (Spain) | SDVECU (Italy) | In `COMPOUND_COMMAND_STEPS`? |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| `ARMDAY1PERI1` | Works | Works | No |
| `ARMNIGHT1PERI1` | Rejected | Works | Yes |
| `ARM1PERI1` | Works | Works | No |
| `DARM1DARMPERI` | Rejected (404) | Works | Yes |

Only the two failing commands are listed in `COMPOUND_COMMAND_STEPS`. For these, the integration detects support at runtime:

1. **First compound command**: Try the single call (e.g. `ARMNIGHT1PERI1`)
2. **If it fails** (`SecuritasDirectError`): Set `_use_multi_step = True`, execute the fallback steps (`ARMNIGHT1` then `PERI1`), and log the switch
3. **Subsequent commands**: Skip the single-call attempt and go straight to multi-step

The `_use_multi_step` flag is per-installation (resets on HA restart). Commands not in the table (`ARMDAY1PERI1`, `ARM1PERI1`) are always sent as-is regardless of the flag.

For disarm, an additional check applies: `DARM1DARMPERI` is only attempted when the perimeter is actually armed (`_last_proto_code` in `PERI_ARMED_PROTO_CODES`). If only the interior is armed, `DARM1` is sent directly.

Home Assistant has five alarm buttons (Home, Away, Night, Vacation, Custom Bypass). The user maps each button to a Securitas state through the options flow. Standard installations get defaults without perimeter; perimeter installations get defaults that use perimeter states for Away (Total + Perimeter) and Custom (Perimeter Only). Both standard and perimeter installations default Night to Partial Night. Perimeter variants (e.g. Partial Night + Perimeter) are available in the options for perimeter installations and can be assigned to any button. The `Vacation` and `Custom Bypass` buttons are hidden unless a mapping is configured for them.

If the alarm is put into a state that is not mapped to any HA button (e.g. the perimeter is armed via a physical panel but perimeter support is not enabled in the integration), the entity reports `ARMED_CUSTOM_BYPASS` and logs the unmapped proto code at `info` level. This is not an error — it simply means the alarm is in a valid Securitas state that the user has not assigned to an HA button. To resolve it, enable perimeter support or map the relevant state in the integration options.

### Data types (`dataTypes.py`)

Dataclasses for API responses. The most important ones:

- `Installation` — Represents a physical Securitas installation (number, alias, panel type, address, capabilities JWT)
- `CheckAlarmStatus` — Alarm status response with `protomResponse` (the single-letter state code) and `protomResponseData`
- `ArmStatus` / `DisarmStatus` — Results of arm/disarm operations
- `Service` — A discovered service (e.g. "CONFORT" for Sentinel sensors, "DOORLOCK" for smart locks)
- `Sentinel` — Temperature, humidity, and air quality from a Sentinel device
- `OtpPhone` — Phone number option during 2FA setup

### Exceptions (`exceptions.py`)

```
SecuritasDirectError          Base class
├── APIError                  API failures
└── LoginError                Login failures
    ├── AuthError             Access denied
    ├── TokenRefreshError     Token refresh issues
    └── Login2FAError         2FA required
```

`SecuritasDirectError` is thrown with up to 4 args: `(message, response_dict, headers, content)`. The `login()` method distinguishes between errors that have response data (wrapped in `LoginError` or `Login2FAError`) and connection errors (re-raised as `SecuritasDirectError` to trigger HA's `ConfigEntryNotReady` retry).

## Integration hub layer

**Location:** `custom_components/securitas/__init__.py`

### SecuritasHub

The central coordinator. It owns an `ApiManager` session and is shared by all entity platforms via `hass.data[DOMAIN][SecuritasHub.__name__]`.

**Key responsibilities:**
- **Login delegation** — Passes credentials through to `ApiManager`
- **Service discovery** — `get_services()` calls `ApiManager.get_all_services()` and caches the results
- **Status polling** — `update_overview()` checks the alarm status using one of two strategies:
  - **Panel check** (default, `check_alarm_panel=True`): Sends `check_alarm()` to get a `referenceId`, waits 1 second, then calls `check_alarm_status()` to poll the panel directly
  - **General status** (`check_alarm_panel=False`): Calls `check_general_status()` which returns the last known cloud status without waking the panel

### Setup flow (`async_setup_entry`)

```
1. Read config entry data into OrderedDict
2. Migrate old config: if no per-button mappings exist, derive from PERI_alarm checkbox
3. Check for device IDs (device_id, unique_id, id_device_indigitall)
   └── Missing? → re-run import flow to generate them
4. Create SecuritasHub with aiohttp session
5. Login
   ├── Login2FAError → show persistent notification, start import flow
   ├── LoginError → show persistent notification, start import flow
   └── SecuritasDirectError → raise ConfigEntryNotReady (HA retries)
6. List installations
7. For each installation: get_services() → create SecuritasDirectDevice
8. Store devices in hass.data[DOMAIN][CONF_INSTALLATION_KEY]
9. Forward to platforms: alarm_control_panel, sensor, lock
```

### Options update (`async_update_options`)

When the user changes options (PIN code, scan interval, alarm mappings, etc.), the listener merges the new options into the config entry data and reloads the integration. This triggers a full teardown and re-setup.

### SecuritasDirectDevice

A thin wrapper around `Installation` that provides `device_info` for the HA device registry. Each physical installation becomes one device.

## Entity platforms

### Alarm control panel (`alarm_control_panel.py`)

The main entity. One `SecuritasAlarm` per installation.

**State mapping system:** During `__init__`, two dictionaries are built from the user's configuration:

- `_command_map`: HA state -> API command string. E.g. `ARMED_AWAY` -> `"ARM1"`. Only includes states the user has mapped (not `NOT_USED`).
- `_status_map`: Protocol response code -> HA state. E.g. `"T"` -> `ARMED_AWAY`. Built by reverse-looking up `PROTO_TO_STATE` for each configured Securitas state.

**`supported_features`** is derived from `_command_map` — only buttons with a configured mapping are exposed.

**Arm flow** (`async_alarm_arm_away` and friends):
```
1. _check_code_for_arm_if_required(code) — if PIN required for arming
2. __force_state(ARMING) — set transitional state, save previous in _last_status
3. set_arm_state(target_mode):
   a. Look up command from _command_map
   b. If _last_status was an armed state → _send_disarm_command() first
      (required because Securitas treats interior and perimeter as independent)
      - Disarm error? Log warning, continue anyway
   c. _send_arm_command(command, **force_params):
      - Not in COMPOUND_COMMAND_STEPS? → single API call
      - In table and _use_multi_step is False? → try single call first
        - SecuritasDirectError? → set _use_multi_step = True, fall back to steps
      - In table and _use_multi_step is True? → send steps sequentially
      - Force params passed to all steps (both interior and perimeter sensors
        can trigger ArmingExceptionError; API ignores irrelevant force params)
      - _last_arm_result tracks the most recent successful step for partial state
   d. On error:
      - Notify user via persistent notification
      - If a prior step succeeded (_last_arm_result), reflect that partial state
      - If no steps succeeded, revert to _last_status
   e. update_status_alarm() with the final response
```

**Disarm flow** (`async_alarm_disarm`):
```
1. _check_code(code) — raises ServiceValidationError if wrong
2. __force_state(DISARMING)
3. _send_disarm_command():
   a. If no perimeter config OR perimeter not armed (_last_proto_code not in
      PERI_ARMED_PROTO_CODES) → send DARM1 directly
   b. If _use_multi_step is True → send DARM1 directly (known that combined
      doesn't work on this panel)
   c. Otherwise → try DARM1DARMPERI; on SecuritasDirectError, set
      _use_multi_step = True and retry with DARM1
   d. Error on all attempts? → _notify_error(), restore _last_status
4. update_status_alarm() with the response
```

**Arming exception flow** (open sensors blocking arm):
```
1. set_arm_state() catches ArmingExceptionError from _send_arm_command()
2. _set_force_context(exc, mode) — stores reference_id, suid, mode, exceptions
3. _notify_arm_exceptions(exc):
   a. Persistent notification: lists each open sensor by name (from _get_exceptions
      polling), explains how to force-arm
   b. Mobile notification (if notify_group configured): short message with
      Force Arm / Cancel action buttons
4. State reverts to _last_status
```

**Force arm flow** (`securitas.force_arm` / `securitas.force_arm_cancel` services):
```
force_arm:
  1. Read stored reference_id, suid, mode from _force_context
  2. _clear_force_context(force=True)
  3. _dismiss_arming_exception_notification()
  4. set_arm_state(mode, force_arming_remote_id=ref_id, suid=suid)
     → API accepts force params and overrides the open-sensor exceptions

force_arm_cancel:
  1. _clear_force_context(force=True)
  2. _dismiss_arming_exception_notification()
  3. async_write_ha_state()

Mobile notification actions:
  - SECURITAS_FORCE_ARM_<num> → async_force_arm()
  - SECURITAS_CANCEL_FORCE_ARM_<num> → _clear_force_context() + write state
```

The `_get_exceptions()` API call uses the same polling pattern as arm/disarm — the server returns `WAIT` on the first poll while the panel reports the open sensors, then `OK` with the full exception list on a subsequent poll.

**Why disarm-before-rearm?** The Securitas API treats interior and perimeter as independent axes. Sending `ARMDAY1` while the perimeter is armed leaves the perimeter armed. Transitioning from `Partial+Perimeter` to `Partial` (no perimeter) would silently fail without disarming first.

**Status updates:** `async_track_time_interval` fires `async_update_status()` every `scan_interval` seconds (default 120). This calls `SecuritasHub.update_overview()` and then `update_status_alarm()` to map the response to an HA state.

**PIN code validation:**
- `_check_code(code)` — Always checked for disarm. Raises `ServiceValidationError` if the code doesn't match the configured PIN. No PIN configured = any code accepted.
- `_check_code_for_arm_if_required(code)` — Only checked for arm operations if `code_arm_required` is True AND a PIN is configured.
- `code_format` — `None` if no PIN configured, `NUMBER` if the PIN is all digits, `TEXT` otherwise.

### Sensors (`sensor.py`)

Three sensor types from Sentinel environmental monitoring devices:

- **SentinelTemperature** — Temperature in Celsius
- **SentinelHumidity** — Humidity as percentage
- **SentinelAirQuality** — Air quality index with message (e.g. "Good")

Sensors are discovered during platform setup by scanning services for ones matching the Sentinel name (language-dependent: "CONFORT" in Spanish, "COMFORTO" in Portuguese). Each sensor polls its data independently via `async_update()` with a 30-minute interval.

### Smart lock (`lock.py`)

`SecuritasLock` controls DOORLOCK services. Discovered during setup by matching `service.request == "DOORLOCK"`.

**Lock states** (string codes from the API):
- `"1"` = open/unlocked
- `"2"` = locked
- `"3"` = opening (transitional)
- `"4"` = locking (transitional)

Lock and unlock operations use `change_lock_mode(lock=True/False)` which follows the same polling pattern as arm/disarm. Status is polled via `get_lock_current_mode()` on the scan interval.

### Refresh button (`button.py`)

`SecuritasRefreshButton` — A simple button entity that calls `SecuritasHub.update_overview()` when pressed. Allows users to manually trigger a status refresh outside the normal polling interval.

## Configuration

### Config flow (`config_flow.py`)

**Initial setup** (`FlowHandler`):
```
Step 1: User enters username, password, country, PIN, 2FA preference
Step 2 (if 2FA): Phone list — user picks which phone to send OTP to
Step 3 (if 2FA): OTP challenge — user enters the SMS code
Final: Login, list installations, create config entry
```

Device IDs are generated during initial setup and stored in the config entry for reuse across restarts.

**Options flow** (`SecuritasOptionsFlowHandler`):
```
Step 1 (init): General settings
  - PIN code (optional, for HA-side validation only)
  - Code required to arm (bool)
  - Perimeter alarm support (bool)
  - Check alarm panel directly (bool)
  - Scan interval (seconds)
  - Delay between status checks (float, 1.0-15.0)

Step 2 (mappings): Alarm state mappings
  - Map Home button → Securitas state
  - Map Away button → Securitas state
  - Map Night button → Securitas state
  - Map Vacation button → Securitas state
  - Map Custom Bypass button → Securitas state
  Available options change based on perimeter support (STD_OPTIONS vs PERI_OPTIONS)
```

Changing options triggers `async_update_options()`, which merges the new values into the config entry and reloads the integration.

## Key data flows

### User arms the alarm from HA

```
User presses "Arm Away" in HA UI
  → async_alarm_arm_away(code)
    → _check_code_for_arm_if_required(code)  # PIN check if configured
    → __force_state(ARMING)                  # UI shows "Arming..."
    → set_arm_state(ARMED_AWAY)
      → _command_map[ARMED_AWAY] = "ARM1PERI1"  (example with peri)
      → _last_status == ARMED_HOME?             # Currently armed?
        → _send_disarm_command()                #   Disarm first
          → _last_proto_code in PERI_ARMED_PROTO_CODES?
            → try DARM1DARMPERI (or DARM1 if _use_multi_step)
          → else → DARM1
        → asyncio.sleep(1)
      → _send_arm_command("ARM1PERI1")
        → _use_multi_step == False?
          → try session.arm_alarm("ARM1PERI1")    # Single compound call
          → SecuritasDirectError? → _use_multi_step = True, fall back ↓
        → _use_multi_step == True?
          → session.arm_alarm("ARM1")             # Step 1: interior
          → session.arm_alarm("PERI1")            # Step 2: perimeter
        → Return ArmStatus with protomResponse="A"
      → update_status_alarm(status)
        → _last_proto_code = "A"
        → _status_map["A"] = ARMED_AWAY
        → _state = ARMED_AWAY                   # UI shows "Armed Away"
```

### Periodic status poll

```
async_track_time_interval fires every scan_interval seconds
  → async_update_status()
    → client.update_overview(installation)
      → check_alarm_panel == True?
        → session.check_alarm(installation)      # Returns referenceId
        → asyncio.sleep(1)
        → session.check_alarm_status(ref_id)      # Polls until not "WAIT"
        → Return CheckAlarmStatus
      → check_alarm_panel == False?
        → session.check_general_status(installation)  # Cloud-only, no panel wake
        → Return CheckAlarmStatus from SStatus
    → update_status_alarm(status)
      → _last_proto_code = status.protomResponse  # Track for disarm decisions
      → protomResponse "D" → DISARMED
      → protomResponse in _status_map → mapped HA state
      → protomResponse unknown → ARMED_CUSTOM_BYPASS + notification
    → async_write_ha_state()
```

### Key fixtures (`conftest.py`)

**API client fixtures:**
- `api` — A real `ApiManager` instance configured with test credentials (`test@example.com`, country `ES`). Uses a `MagicMock` for the HTTP client so no real network calls are made.
- `mock_execute` — Patches `ApiManager._execute_request` so tests can set return values without going through HTTP. Most auth and operation tests use this.
- `mock_post` / `mock_response` — Lower-level mocks for the `aiohttp` POST context manager, used by `test_execute_request.py` to test header construction and error handling.

**JWT helpers:**
- `make_jwt(exp_minutes=15)` — Creates a real HS256 JWT with a configurable expiry. Used to test token parsing, expiry detection, and refresh logic.
- `FAKE_JWT` / `FAKE_REFRESH_TOKEN` — Pre-built JWTs for common test scenarios.

**Response factories:**
- `login_response()`, `refresh_response()`, `validate_device_response()` — Build realistic API response dicts with sensible defaults and overridable fields.

**Integration fixtures:**
- `make_installation(**overrides)` — Factory for `Installation` dataclass with defaults (number, panel, address, etc.).
- `make_config_entry_data()` — Builds a complete config entry data dict with all required keys.
- `make_securitas_hub_mock()` — Creates a `MagicMock` mimicking `SecuritasHub` with `AsyncMock` methods for login, validate_device, etc.
- `setup_integration_data(hass, client, devices)` — Populates `hass.data[DOMAIN]` the same way `async_setup_entry` does.

### Testing patterns

**API client tests** (test_auth, test_operations, test_services, test_execute_request): Use the `api` + `mock_execute` fixtures. Tests call the real method (e.g. `api.login()`) with a mocked `_execute_request` return value, then assert on state changes (`api.authentication_token`, `api.authentication_token_exp`, etc.).

**HA platform tests** (test_alarm_panel, test_button, test_ha_platforms): Create entity instances directly with `MagicMock` dependencies. Patch `async_track_time_interval` and HA state-writing methods to avoid needing a running HA event loop. Example:

```python
alarm = make_alarm(has_peri=True)  # Creates SecuritasAlarm with mocked hub
alarm.client.session.arm_alarm = AsyncMock(return_value=arm_status)
await alarm.async_alarm_arm_away()
assert alarm._state == AlarmControlPanelState.ARMED_AWAY
```

**Config flow tests** (test_config_flow): Use the `hass` fixture from `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` and HA's flow manager API:

```python
result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_init(DOMAIN, context={"source": SOURCE_USER})
result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_configure(result["flow_id"], user_input={...})
assert result["type"] == FlowResultType.FORM
```

**Integration setup tests** (test_init): Patch `SecuritasHub` constructor and `async_forward_entry_setups` to test the full `async_setup_entry` flow without loading real platforms.

### Integration tests (`test_integration.py`, `mock_graphql.py`)

Integration tests exercise the full stack from HA config-entry setup through to API behaviour, using a `MockGraphQLServer` that intercepts `aiohttp` POST calls at the HTTP transport level. Unlike unit tests, these let `_execute_request()` run fully — header construction, JSON parsing, and error handling are all exercised.

**How the mock server works:**

`MockGraphQLServer` (in `tests/mock_graphql.py`) replaces `http_client.post` on `ApiManager`. Each call reads the `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-NAME` header, records the call, and returns the next queued response for that operation:

```python
server = MockGraphQLServer()
server.add_response("mkLoginToken", graphql_login())
server.add_response("mkInstallationList", graphql_installations())
server.set_default_response("CheckAlarm", graphql_check_alarm())

mock_http = server.make_http_client()
with patch("custom_components.securitas.async_get_clientsession", return_value=mock_http):
    result = await async_setup_entry(hass, entry)

assert server.call_count("mkLoginToken") == 1
_, headers, _ = server.get_calls("CheckAlarm")[0]
assert headers["numinst"] == "123456"
```

Key design choices:
- **Queue-based**: each operation has a FIFO queue; `set_default_response()` provides a fallback when the queue is empty
- **Records all calls**: tests can assert on operation name, request headers, and JSON body
- **`queue_standard_setup()`**: convenience helper that queues login → list_installations → services and sets defaults for alarm status calls
- **Response factories**: `graphql_login()`, `graphql_installations()`, `graphql_alarm_status()`, `graphql_arm()`, `graphql_disarm()`, `graphql_sentinel()`, etc. return dicts matching the real Securitas GraphQL schema

**What integration tests cover:**
- Full setup flow: login → list installations → get services → forward platforms
- JWT parsing: authentication token expiry set correctly from `mkLoginToken` response
- Error handling: `LoginError`, `Login2FAError`, connection errors → correct return values
- Scoped request headers: `numinst`, `panel`, `X-Capabilities` present on installation-scoped calls
- Operation routing: `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-NAME` header matches the operation name for every call
- State from real API responses: `CheckAlarmStatus` proto codes map to correct HA states
- Polling behaviour: `ArmStatus`/`DisarmStatus` WAIT responses are retried
- Sensor data: `get_sentinel_data()` and `get_air_quality_data()` parse real response shapes
- Unload: `async_unload_entry` cleans up `hass.data[DOMAIN]` correctly

### CI workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yaml`)

Three parallel jobs run on every PR and push to main:

1. **Ruff lint & format** — `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .`
2. **Pyright** — `pyright custom_components/` for static type checking
3. **Tests** — `pytest` with `--cov-fail-under=90` to enforce minimum coverage
